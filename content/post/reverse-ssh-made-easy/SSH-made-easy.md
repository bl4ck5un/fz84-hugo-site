# Settings

SSH (Secure Shell) is a must-have tool for many developers who heavily rely on
SSH to script and manage their remote servers. However, using SSH in reality is
often not as handy as I'd expect.

- For example,
if the remote server is behind a firewall or NAT (which is often the case when
you're using servers owned by enterprises or universities), SSH
requires additional configuration or you'd have to setup a VPN prior to SSH.
VPN is not that bad but it slows down the network quite
significantly, as least in my case I can feel the latency.
- Even worse, if your remote server sits behind a router, say you have
a Linux box at home, with no dedicated public IP from you IPS, it's quite not
easy to get SSH works. You need to configure port forwarding on the
router, and figure out a way to broadcast the IP address.

All these inconveniences dwarf the handy nature of SSH. But we'll not
live with it. Fortunately, SSH is built-in
with abilities to mitigate this --- reverse SSH, aka SSH tunneling is a powerful
feature yet some explanation is required to understand how it works and
how to setup a hassle-free access to your remote server using this technique.

# Step-by-step setup

The setting I'm dealing with is illustrated in the following figure. There
are three parties involved:

![figure2](../aws-ssh.png)

- the remote server, with hostname `cs`
- a cloud server with public IP, with hostname `aws-ssh`
- the client, running ordinary `ssh` client

## setup reverse tunnel

To setup a reverse tunnel, one need firstly to inform the cloud server of
the identity of our remote server, the other end-point of this SSH tunnel
being established. To this end, execute this on the remote server:

    ssh -fN -R 7000:localhost:22 -i aws-key.pem ec2-user@52.10.241.71

This command tell the cloud server (`52.10.241.71`) to forward all traffic
going to port 7000 to 22 on the other end of this channel.
In other words, if connecting to `52.10.241.71:7000`, all traffic eventually
arrives at 22 port on remote server. Other parameters are also important,

- `-f`: requests ssh to go to background just before command execution
- `-N`: do not execute a remote command
- `-i`: read in `aws-key.pem` as login the cloud server

To test whether reverse tunnel works, try to connect to `localhost:22`
on the AWS Server:

    ssh fanz@localhost -p 7000

If prompted with login, great, it works!

## connect from clients

Okay now we have a reverse tunnel working on the AWS server. Let's move on to
accept connections from clients. The simplest way for
a client to connect to the remote server is to chain SSH commands in this way,

    ssh -i aws-key.pem ec2-user@52.10.241.71 'ssh fz84@localhost -p 7000'

Straightforward as it seems, this method has a major drawback -- it degraded
security. Owners of the immediate AWS server can witness all traffic if
he/she wants.

A better approach to this end is to use `ProxyCommand` feature, introduced in
OpenSSH v1.2. On the client, add the following to `~/.ssh/config`:

  	Host aws-ssh
          HostName 52.10.241.71
          User ec2-user
          IdentityFile aws-key.pem

    Host cs
        User fz48
        ProxyCommand ssh -W localhost:7000 aws-ssh

- `Host`: Defines for which host or hosts the configuration section applies.
  The section ends with a new Host section or the end of the file.
- `User`: Defines the username for the SSH connection. Useful if your username
  on the remote host is different from your local username.
- `HostName`: Defines the literal hostname for the remote server. Useful if a
  nickname for the host is used in the Host line.
- `ProxyCommand`: Specifies the proxy command for the connection. This command is
  launched prior to making the connection to Hostname.
- `-W host:port`: Requests that standard input and output on the client be
 forwarded to host on port over the secure channel.

The final mistery left is which command we should use to connect to `cs`.
It turn out to be very simple. Just type in `ssh cs`. It just works!
By doing this, the ProxyCommand is firstly executed, which forwards `STDIN`
and `STDOUT` to `localhost:7000`, then login to `aws-ssh`. Since we already
have a reverse tunnel "listening" on port 7000, whatever I/O happens toward
terminal is forwarded to that port, then the final stop, port 22 on `cs`.
